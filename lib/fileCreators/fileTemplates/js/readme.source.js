Node.js [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) REST*like* SOA*like* API generator for SPAs.

Convention over configuration? Why choose?! Welcome to the configurable convention!

* If Rails is too constrictive but Express is too open ended then this is the framework for you.

* If you want to generate boilerplate so you can focus on development, but still have the full power to do anything at any time, this is the framework for you.

* If you’re a newbie, starting out and want to build web apps quickly I’d advise Rails. Solid MVC fundamentals will do you well. Once you come back note that you wont find 'fat' models here, but an SOA based architecture!

* If you know what MVC is and appreciate Rails, but want the speed and power of Node.js, this is the framework for you.

**All feedback wellcome, I want this tool to be the best tool it can be!**

*RESTlike because you're free to do what you want with your routes.*

*SOAlike because SOA by definition are over the network, however the services in sapphire don't have to be over the network - because you're free to do what you want with your services.*
